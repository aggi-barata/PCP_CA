\section{Concluding Remarks}
In this paper,  we have constructed PCP's with linear predicates that simultaneously 
achieve polynomially small completeness error and poly logarithmic soundness error. We have 
also identified some immediate applications to our new constructions. We are sure that the theory of completeness amplification will find more applicability elsewhere in near future.
