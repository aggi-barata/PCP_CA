We construct the first PCP verifier that performs linear tests and has polynomially small completeness error simultaneously with logarithmic randomness,
constant number of queries, constant alphabet and constant soundness error. 
Prior to our work, the smallest completeness error that was known in such circumstances was an arbitrarily small constant.

We use the verifier we construct to explore several problems:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em Threshold behavior:} We study \textsc{Max-3Lin} and \textsc{Max-3Sat} around their approximability thresholds. Specifically, we show that \textsc{Max-3Lin} and \textsc{Max-3Sat} become {\sf NP}-hard to approximate at $1/2 + 1/(\log n)^\alpha$ and $7/8 + 1/(\log n)^{\alpha}$, respectively, for some $\alpha > 0$. Moreover, we identify
the bottleneck for achieving an optimal (up to the constant $\alpha$) hardness of $1/2 + 1/n^{\alpha}$ and $7/8 + 1/n^\alpha$. We show that further improvements in low error projection games could replace the $1/(\log n)^{\alpha}$ in our results with $1/n^\alpha$.

\item {\em Polynomial hardness factors:} We show that the \textsc{Nearest-Codeword-Problem} for binary linear codes, as well as the \textsc{Min-3Lin-Deletion} problem are {\sf NP}-hard up to a polynomial approximation factor.
\end{enumerate}
